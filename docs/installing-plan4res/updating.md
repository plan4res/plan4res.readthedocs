#### Update plan4res scripts and documentation

The following directories can be updated:

-   P4R_DIR/documentation

-   P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/python/openentrance: to update the
    openENTRANCE nomenclature definition.

-   P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/python/plan4res-scripts: to update the data
    processing and visualization scripts

-   P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/include: to update the launching scripts

To check if new versions are available, run the following commands:

1.  cd P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/python/openentrance

2.  git fetch \--dry-run \--verbose

If the following output is displayed, it means your installation is up
to date:

height="0.9599464129483815in"}

Otherwise, you can perform the update using:

3.  git pull

Do the same with the repositories
p4r-env/scripts/python/plan4res-scripts and p4r-env/scripts/include if
necessary.

#### Update example of dataset

When installing plan4res, an example of dataset is created in
P4R_DIR/data/toyDataset

As plan4res may have been ran in this dataset, it is not recommended to
update it but to download the last version of this toyDataset:

-   From P4R_DIR/p4r-env/data, change the name of the dataset (mv
    toyDataset toyDataset_save)

-   Download the new version of the dataset:

> git clone <https://github.com/plan4res/toyDataset>
