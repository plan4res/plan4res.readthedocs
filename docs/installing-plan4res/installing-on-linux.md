### Installing on Linux

#### Install python:

Python3 must be the default version of python

The following python packages must be installed (e.g. with pip-install):

> *setuptools, openpyxl, scipy, pandas, pyyaml, matplotlib, geopandas,
> fiona, descartes, shapely, pillow, mapclassify, numpy, requests,
> requests-toolbelt, rtree, pygeos, wheel, netCDF4, pyam-iamc*

#### Install SMS++ dependencies

The requirements for installing SMS++ are described in the SMS++ gitlab
repo[^1]. Their installation may be included in the installation script
of SMS++, but, in particular in the case of a Linux installation, the
version which would be installed depend on which linux OS is installed
(and which version), and thus may be too old. (This in particular
happens on linux Debian::bullseye). In that case you should install
manually a more recent version.

For each SOFTWARE install, on linux, PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be
updated to include \$SOFTWARE_PATH/mpi and \$SOFTWARE_PATH/mpi/lib. For
BOOST, the variable \$BOOST_PATH must also be set.

-   **Boost**[^2] **(minimum version 1.87).**

-   **OpenMPI**[^3] **(minimum version 3.1.4) OR MPICH**[^4] **(minimum
    version 3.3.2)**

-   **NETCDF**[^5] **(minimum version 4.9.2) and NETCDFCXX (minimum
    version: 4.3.1).**

-   **Eigen**[^6] **(minimum version 3.3.7)**

-   **Cmake**[^7] **(minimum version 3.28.1)**

#### Install plan4res

> Mkdir P4R_DIR (can be any directory name)
>
> cd P4R_DIR
>
> git clone <https://github.com/plan4res/install>
>
> chmod a+x \*.sh
>
> ./plan4res_install.sh -X -S \<SOLVER\> \[-D \<solverpath\>\] \[-I
> \<installer\>\] \[-L \<license\>\] \[-v \<version\>\] \[-M \<mpi\>\]
>
> Where:

-   SOLVER is the chosen solver among CPLEX, GUROBI, SCIP, HiGHS. If
    > this option is not provided, HiGHS is chosen

-   solverpath is to be provided if the solver is already installed in
    > your system. In that case you need to provide the path where it is
    > installed

    -   for CPLEX: solverpath is where you find e.g. cplex/bin and
        cplex/lib

    -   for GUROBI: solverpath is where you find e.g. gurobi1101/linux64
        and gurobi1101/gurobi.lic is version 11.01 is installed

    -   for HiGHS: solverpath is where you find bin, include and lib

-   Installer is the installer file for CPLEX of Gurobi, the -I option
    > must only be provided when CPLEX or GUROBI are chosen

-   License is the license file, only for GUROBI

-   Version is the solver version, only for SCIP

-   mpi is the chosen MPI version among MPICH and OpenMPI. If this
    > option is not provided, OpenMPI is chosen.
