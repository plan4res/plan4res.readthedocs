# Quick Run

- Create dataset in P4R_DIR_LOCAL/data (e.g. YourDataset), with a subdirectory IAMC, a subdirectory settings and a subdirectory TimeSeries

- Move your IAMC file (as computed by GENeSYS-MOD for instance) in IAMC/ and rename it YourDataset.xlsx

- Copy the settings files from P4R_DIR_LOCAL/data/settings/toyDataset to settings/

- Create or get and Upload your timeseries to TimeSeries

- Edit configuration files in settings:

  - Edit settingsCreatePlan4res_simul.yml and settingsCreatePlan4res_invest.yml (in particular the IAMC scenario and year, the list of regions, the regions partitions, the list of technologies, the list of scenarios, the definition of coupling constraints, the initial filling rates, the (optional) parameters for capacity expansion, and if necessary the list of variables to use from your IAMC file)

  - Edit DictTimeSeries.yml (so that is has the good names for your timeseries)

  - If necessary (if you have changed some variable names in settingsCreatePlan4res_XXX.yml), edit the VariablesDictionnary.yml

- Run CREATE: p4r CREATE YourDataset (with option -M invest if running a capacity expansion case)

- Edit settings_format_optim.yml, settings_format_simul.yml and settings_format_invest.yml configuration files in settings (in particular the sections Calendar, and the Scenarios and ScenarisedData in section ParametersFormat)

- Run SSV: p4r SSV YourDataset

- Run SIM: p4r SIM YourDataset

- Run CEM: p4r CEM YourDataset

- Edit settingsPostTreatPlan4res_simul.yml and settingsPostTreatPlan4res_invest.yml in settings. In particular, the start and end dates of you study, the list of technologies (if you added new technologies), and the size of graphs (to allow to cope with all regions / all interconnections / all technos)

- Run POSTTREAT: p4r POSTTREAT YourDataset (with option -M invest if running a capacity expansion case)
