# Installation of the full plan4res environment, for all operating systems

Requirements: at least 3G available.

Move to your install directory: cd P4R_DIR, and type the following commands:

cd P4R_DIRgit clone [https://github.com/plan4res/install](https://github.com/plan4res/install)mv ./install/* . && rm -rf installchmod a+x *.sh./plan4res_install.sh [-S <SOLVER>] [-I <installer>] [-L <license>] [-v <version>] [-M <mpi>]Where:

- SOLVER is the chosen solver among CPLEX, GUROBI, SCIP, HiGHS. If this option is not provided, HiGHS is chosen

- Installer is the installer file for CPLEX of Gurobi, the -I option must only be provided when CPLEX or GUROBI are chosen

- License is the license file, only for GUROBI

- Version is the solver version, only for SCIP

- Mpi is the chosen MPI version among MPICH and OpenMPI. If this option is not provided, OpenMPI is chosen.

**Examples:**

./plan4res_install.sh

- Installs plan4res with HiGHS

./plan4res_install.sh -S CPLEX -I cplex_studio2211.linux_x86_64.bin

- Installs plan4res with CPLEX, using ths installer cplex_studio2211.linux_x86_64.bin available in P4R_DIR

./plan4res_install.sh -S GUROBI -I gurobi11.0.1_linux64.tar.gz -L gurobi.lic

- Installs plan4res with GUROBI using the gurobi installer and licence available in P4R_DIR

./plan4res_install.sh -S SCIP -v 9.1.1

- Installs plan4res with SCIP, choses the version 9.1.1 from SCIP

It is possible to configure a specific location where the user wishes to run plan4res. This also allows to install the software once on e.g. a shared directory in an organization, and run it on different user’s sessions.

For doing so, copy the script user_init_plan4res.sh which is present in P4R_DIR to the location where the user wants to run plan4res, e.g. P4R_DIR_LOCAL and run the command:

./user_init_plan4res -D P4R_DIR -S SOLVER

Where:

- P4R_DIR is the directory where plan4res has been previously installed

- SOLVER is the chosen solver among CPLEX, GUROBI, SCIP, HiGHS. If this option is not provided, HiGHS is chosen (this allows to configure the settings files in the example of dataset according to the choice of the solver)

Follow the procedure ‘Installing on Linux’

The procedure is available at [**https://gitlab.com/cerl/plan4res/p4r-env#windows**](https://gitlab.com/cerl/plan4res/p4r-env#windows). It is reproduced below with some more information.

Installation requires Windows 7 Pro 64bit SP1 or higher and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6) 3.0 or higher. Furthermore, the CPU must support [hardware virtualization](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch10.html#hwvirt). On many systems, the hardware virtualization features first need to be enabled in the BIOS.

- Install Git for Windows (use default settings) [https://git-for-windows.github.io/](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)

- Install VirtualBox and Extension Pack [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

- Install Vagrant [https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

- (Optional) Install Vagrant Manager [http://vagrantmanager.com/downloads/](http://vagrantmanager.com/downloads/)

The goal of Vagrant and VirtualBox is to emulate a UNIX system on the Windows computer. Vagrant Manager provides a GUI to facilitate the management of the VM.

Run Git Bash.

If working behind a proxy, define the following environment variables:

export http_proxy = <proxy address>:<port>

export https_proxy = ${http_proxy}

Move to your installation directory:

cd P4R_DIR

Then enter the following commands:

git clone [https://github.com/plan4res/install](https://github.com/plan4res/install)mv ./install/* .chmod a+x *.sh./plan4res_install.sh [-S <SOLVER>] [-I <installer>] [-L <license>] [-v <version>] -M MPICH -V <memory>Where:

- SOLVER is the chosen solver among CPLEX, GUROBI, SCIP, HiGHS. If this option is not provided, HiGHS is chosen

- Installer is the installer file for CPLEX of Gurobi, the -I option must only be provided when CPLEX or GUROBI are chosen

- License is the license file, only for GUROBI

- Version is the solver version, only for SCIP

**Examples:**

./plan4res_install.sh -M MPICH -V 8192

- Installs plan4res with HiGHS

./plan4res_install.sh -M MPICH -V 8192 -S CPLEX -I cplex_studio2211.linux_x86_64.bin

- Installs plan4res with CPLEX, using ths installer cplex_studio2211.linux_x86_64.bin available in P4R_DIR

./plan4res_install.sh -M MPICH -V 8192 -S GUROBI -I gurobi11.0.1_linux64.tar.gz -L gurobi.lic

- Installs plan4res with GUROBI using the gurobi installer and licence available in P4R_DIR

./plan4res_install.sh -M MPICH -V 8192 -S SCIP -v 9.1.1

- Installs plan4res with SCIP, choses the version 9.1.1 from SCIP

To avoid issues with memory fragmentation while using Vagrant, we advise to allocate at least 8 Gb of RAM if the computer can afford it. This can be done via the -V option of the installation command (see above), but you can also edit the file *Vagrantfile* located in *P4R_DIR/p4r-env*, edit parameter vb.memory (in Mb):

You may also increase the number of CPUs allocated to the VM if possible, on your machine. In above example, it is set to 6.

./plan4res_install.sh -U p4r-env

./plan4res_install.sh -U stopt

./plan4res_install.sh -U sms++

./plan4res_install.sh -S New_SOLVER [ -I installer -L licence -v version] (installer to be provided in New_SOLVER is CPLEX or GUROBI, licence to be provided if New_SOLVER is GUROBI, version to be provided in New_SOLVER is SCIP)

./plan4res_install.sh -S SOLVER -U SOLVER [ -I installer -L licence -v version] (installer to be provided in New_SOLVER is CPLEX or GUROBI, licence to be provided if New_SOLVER is GUROBI, version to be provided in New_SOLVER is SCIP)

The following directories can be updated:

- P4R_DIR/documentation

- P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/python/openentrance: to update the openENTRANCE nomenclature definition.

- P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/python/plan4res-scripts: to update the data processing and visualization scripts

- P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/include: to update the launching scripts

To check if new versions are available, run the following commands:

1. 1

  

  

2. cd P4R_DIR/p4r-env/scripts/python/openentrance

  git fetch --dry-run --verbose

If the following output is displayed, it means your installation is up to date:

![](media/media/image2.png)

Otherwise, you can perform the update using:

1. 3

  

  

2. git pull

Do the same with the repositories p4r-env/scripts/python/plan4res-scripts and p4r-env/scripts/include if necessary.

When installing plan4res, an example of dataset is created in P4R_DIR/data/toyDataset

As plan4res may have been ran in this dataset, it is not recommended to update it but to download the last version of this toyDataset:

- From P4R_DIR/p4r-env/data, change the name of the dataset (mv toyDataset toyDataset_save)

- Download the new version of the dataset:

git clone [https://github.com/plan4res/toyDataset](https://github.com/plan4res/toyDataset)
