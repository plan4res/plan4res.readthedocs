with the following set of options :

-a, --save-state <prefix> Save states of the InvestmentBlock solver.

-B, --blockcfg <file> Block configuration.

-b, --load-state <file> Load a state for the InvestmentBlock solver.

-c, --configdir <path> The prefix for all config filenames.

-e, --eliminate-redundant-cuts Eliminate given redundant cuts.

-h, --help Print this help.

-l, --load-cuts <file> Load cuts from a file.

Detailed documentation as well as examples of configuration files can be found on the SMS++ repository : [SMS++ / Tools · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/smspp/tools/-/tree/master/)

InvestmentBlock.nc4 is the netcdf input file. SDDPBlock.nc4 and Block$i.nc4 (at all $i stages) are also needed (they must be in the directory given with option -p); they can be generated by the formatting tool, mode INVESTandSDDPandUC.

investment_solver requires specific configuration file for SMS++: BSPar-Investment.txt, as well as a configuration file for the SIM: sddp_greedy_investment.txt (see 7.2), and the configuration file of ucblock_solver (see 7.4.)
