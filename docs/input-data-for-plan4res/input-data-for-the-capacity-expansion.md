### Input data for the capacity expansion

For running the capacity expansion model, we need:

-   The list of technologies that could be invested

-   For each technology that could be invested, the maximum potential of
    the technology, ie the maximum possible added capacity per node.

This includes the generation technologies, but also the storages (except
seasonal storages) and the interconnections (if they can be invested,
for each interconnection, what is the maximum additional capacity)
