## The plan4res commands: p4r and sp4r

p4r and sp4r are available for using them after installing and
configuring plan4res. They allow to run all modules of plan4res
(installed in P4R_DIR) from any directory of the user account configured
by user_init_plan4res. Independently of the directory in which you are
located when running p4r or sp4r, both commands will consider that the
datasets are in P4R_DIR_LOCAL/data and the results will also be written
in this directory.
