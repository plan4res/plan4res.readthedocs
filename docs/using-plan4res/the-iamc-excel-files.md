### The IAMC excel file(s)

This data file(s), which in general has(have) been created using the
GENeSYS-MOD linkage scripts, and contains a number of inputs and outputs
from GENeSYS-MOD, follows the common IAMC format[^18]. It thus describes
a number of scenarios for the transition of the energy system in a
number of regions. It is composed of the following columns: Model,
Scenario, Region, Variable, Unit and a number of columns corresponding
to years, plus an optional column subannual.

Each row gives, for each of the years, the values of a the variable
whose name is in column *Variable*, in the region named in column
*Region*, for the scenario named in column *Scenario*, generated by the
model named in column *Mode, l* using the unit specified in the column
*Unit* for the different years defined in the columns named by year
indexes. When there exist a *subannual* column, the value of the
variable is valid only for the subset of the years such as defined in
column *subannual*.

A typical IAMC file computed out of GENeSYS-MOD shall contain the
following variables (see the definition of the variables in the
nomenclature[^19]), for each of the considered regions and years:

-   Final Energy\|Electricity

-   Final Energy\|Electricity\|\<component of final energy
    electricity\>, where \|\<component of final energy electricity\> is
    among Cooking, Cooling, Heating, Transportation, Electrolizer.....
    (representing the different uses of electricity)

-   Network\|Electricity\|Maximum Flow

-   Network\|Electricity\|Expansion Cost

-   Capacity\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation and storage
    technologies\>

-   Variable Cost (incl. Fuel Cost)\|Electricity\|\<Electricity
    generation technologies\>

Note that it is possible to use more than one IAMC file to create a
dataset. Some other variables such as variables to define dynamic
constraints for individual plants may be provided in these IAMC files,
such as:

-   Data related to other coupling constraints (reserves....):

    -   Network\|Electricity\|Reserve\|Requirement\|Frequency
        Containment

    -   Network\|Electricity\|Reserve\|Requirement\|Automatic Frequency
        Restoration

    -   Network\|Electricity\|Requirement\|Inertia

-   Data related to the definition of individual power plants and their
    dynamic constraints:

    -   Maximum Active Power\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation and
        storage technologies\>

    -   Minimum Active Power\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation and
        storage technologies\>

    -   Start-Up Cost\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation
        technologies\>

    -   Minimum Off Duration\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation and
        storage technologies\>

    -   Minimum On Duration\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation and
        storage technologies\>

-   Data related to provision of system services by technologies

    -   Inertia\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation technologies\>

    -   Frequency Containment Reserve\|Electricity\|\<Electricity
        generation and storage technologies\>

    -   Automatic Frequency Restoration
        Reserve\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation and storage
        technologies\>

-   Data related to outages

    -   Forced Outage Rate\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation
        technologies\>

    -   Planned Outage Rate\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation
        technologies\>

    -   Mean Outage Duration\|Electricity\|\<Electricity generation
        technologies\>

-   Data necessary if the variable cost of a technology is computed from
    its efficiency and the price of the used fuel

    -   Efficiency\|\<Electricity generation technologies\>

    -   Price\|\<fuels\>
