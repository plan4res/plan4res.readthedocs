# Using plan4res

This section describes what are the input data of plan4res, for running
the different modules (SSV: computation of strategies for the management
of seasonal storages, SIM: simulation on a selected year of the
operation of the power system, CEM: capacity expansion)

The correspondence of each input data with the IAMC nomenclature is
provided in purple.

Data which can be calculated out of the inputs/outputs of GENeSYS-MOD
are also identified in **green**. Data which are required but must be
added compared to the inputs/ouputs of GENeSYS-MOD are identified in
**red.** Other optional data are in blue.

Data formats are described in section
