## Running the CEM

investment_solver \[options\] InvestmentBlock.nc4

with the following set of options :

-a, \--save-state \<prefix\> Save states of the InvestmentBlock solver.

-B, \--blockcfg \<file\> Block configuration.

-b, \--load-state \<file\> Load a state for the InvestmentBlock solver.

-c, \--configdir \<path\> The prefix for all config filenames.

-e, \--eliminate-redundant-cuts Eliminate given redundant cuts.

-h, \--help Print this help.

-l, \--load-cuts \<file\> Load cuts from a file.

-n, \--num-blocks \<number\> Number of sub-Blocks per stage.

-o, \--output-solution Output the solutions.

-p, \--prefix \<path\> The prefix for all Block filenames.

-S, \--solvercfg \<file\> Solver configuration.

-s, \--simulate Simulate the given investment.

-x, \--initial-investment \<file\> Initial investment.

Detailed documentation as well as examples of configuration files can be
found on the SMS++ repository : [SMS++ / Tools ·
GitLab](https://gitlab.com/smspp/tools/-/tree/master/)

InvestmentBlock.nc4 is the netcdf input file. SDDPBlock.nc4 and
Block\$i.nc4 (at all \$i stages) are also needed (they must be in the
directory given with option -p); they can be generated by the formatting
tool, mode INVESTandSDDPandUC.

investment_solver requires specific configuration file for SMS++:
BSPar-Investment.txt, as well as a configuration file for the SIM:
sddp_greedy_investment.txt (see 7.2), and the configuration file of
ucblock_solver (see 7.4.)

[^24]: Note that data consistency is ensured: if MinPower \> MaxPower at
    some point, then MinPower = MaxPower. For example, this is useful if
    MaxPower = 0 during a period to model a maintenance or an outage.
    For thermal units, MinPower constraint applies only if the unit is
    started.

[^25]: As in ThermalUnits, consistency between MinPower and MaxPower is
    ensured such that Minpower can never be greater than MaxPower.

[^26]: Note that for hydro storages, MinPower forces the plant to run:
    it aims at representing hydro operational constraints such as
    minimal river flows. It is different from the MinPower constraint
    applied to thermal units.

[^27]: Consistency between MinVolume and MaxVolume is ensured, such that
    MinVolume can never be greater than MaxVolume.
