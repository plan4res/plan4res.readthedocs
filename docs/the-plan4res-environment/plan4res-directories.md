directory (say, P4R_INSTALL_DIR), you will get the structure shown in

You may also choose to run plan4res in a separated directory. This
allows, in particular when installing on a server, to install the
software only once, and have each user specify a personal directory (by

[plan4res/install](https://github.com/plan4res/install)). Each user will
then have in their P4R_LOCAL_DIR directory the structure shown in Figure
